# MSO Development Task

Responsive navigation bar with dropdown menus.


## Running the Gulp task

1. Clone the project from GitHub:
`git clone git@github.com:martynlocker/mso-header.git`

2. Enter the project folder:
`cd mso-header`

3. Install node_modules:
`npm install`

4. You can run a one-off build, which compiles all assets - HTML, CSS, JS & SVGs - from within the `src` folder to within the `dist` directory with the following command:
`gulp`

5. Or you can run the following command, which watches the `src` directory, compiles any changes into the `dist` directory and automatically refreshes the browser window using BrowserSync so your changes are immediately visible:
`gulp watch`
